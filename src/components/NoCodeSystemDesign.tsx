          <p>
            Efficiency shouldn't require a dedicated engineering team. I specialize in designing and implementing robust business systems using powerful "no-code" and "low-code" tools like Zapier, Make.com, and various CRM integrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage of this approach is simplicity and autonomy. I build sophisticated automation and data management systems that your internal team can actually manage and update themselves. This removes the need for expensive technical retainers or constant reliance on outside contractors for every minor change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's syncing lead data between your website and CRM, automating client onboarding, or creating custom internal dashboards, I provide solutions that are as powerful as they are accessible.
